- An application to clean up ugly HTML exports

This application is used together with FiiNote. This note-taking application offers HTML export, though the exported file is so ugly that it is unusable.
This application converts Unicode HTML entities to normal characters, changes head and footer, and creates HTML lists from numbered or bulleted list.
